                    <h1>Metaverse: the idea and the technologies behind it</h1>
                    <p> the idea and the technologies behind it ‘To Next Web’ had
                    an insightful conversation with Vitalii Vashchuk, Director, Co-Head,
                    and Gaming Technologist at EPAM Systems, a leading software
                    engineering company. He shared his knowledge regarding the
                    developments for metaverse creation along with the related potential
                    challenges. In Vitalii’s opinion, Metaverse can be understood as a
                    concept that aims to build better communication and experiences for
                    the people, through the people, and by the people. It is evolving to
                    substitute Web2.0, allowing people more freedom to express themselves
                    and share their creativity without any limitations. Blockchain, NFTs
                    (Non-Fungible Tokens), AI (Artificial Intelligence), and IoT (Internet
                    of things) are some of the technologies the building blocks of the
                    metaverse, and their use inside of the metaverse would depend upon
                    different use cases.

                    Repairability will be seen as added value, creating a new dimension in market segmentation. People will consider “truly” repairable products as robust, updatable, re-sellable and therefore of higher value. Conversely, products that need to be replaced if broken will be perceived as being of lower value and poorly made — or even purposefully designed to become obsolete.
                    For instance, brands like Fairphone and Framework are setting the bar of repairability in the consumer electronics industry, becoming reference points of how durable and upgradable products should be designed.
                    However, if brands truly want to increase the perceived value of their goods, and consequently their margins, they can’t just offer repairable products — they’ll need to enable the repair of those products by offering a compelling repair experience and related content.

                    <h1>PERSONALIZED RESEARCH: THE STATUS QUO IS NO LONGER SUSTAINABLE</h1>
                    Then, COVID came along. The realities of the post-pandemic world have already started biting and have significantly accelerated earlier trends with the shift to digital interaction, expectation of lower fees and willingness to switch providers being examples among the six megatrends identified in a recent global survey of investors and wealth managers by ThoughtLab.
                    While deep client relationships are still important, in APAC the model is changing. As inter-generational wealth transfers start to occur, the younger scions of ultra-wealthy families often have a great affinity for digitization and prefer enhanced digital experiences. In addition, they may prefer to be connected to bankers around their age who are also digital natives, rather than with their parents’ bankers. For example, they can connect with the younger bankers via social media, chat applications and video calls, whereas their parents’ bankers may not be so digitally inclined. Intuitive digital experiences and innovative investment ideas are the top criteria for these tech-savvy investors.
